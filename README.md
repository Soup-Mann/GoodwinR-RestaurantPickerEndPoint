 Restaurant Picker- It will select a restaurant out of categorys or completely random
 
 Peer review by Carlos Felipe: This was a fun program to run. I like the used of multiple categories and the fourth one was really neat to look at the responses. The code itself looks polished and I liked that it had data validation even though it was not a requirement. Overall good job.
